Ian sat down to review Rich’s code,  
But his patience was wearing a heavy load.  
Commits were scattered, no rhyme or reason,  
Like bugs popping up in the wrong season.  

"Fix typo," "Oops, forgot this part,"  
Rich’s commit history was breaking Ian’s heart.  
Lines jumped around like a jittery cat,  
How was Ian supposed to make sense of that?  

He sighed and mumbled, “What’s Rich been drinking?”  
As he stared at the code with his brain slowly sinking.  
But with a grin, Ian clicked through with flair,  
After all, programmers know chaos is everywhere!
