Rich sat down to review Ian's code,  
But his patience was wearing a heavy load.  
Commits were scattered, no rhyme or reason,  
Like bugs popping up in the wrong season.  

"Fix typo," "Oops, forgot this part,"  
Ian's commit history was breaking Rich's heart.  
Lines jumped around like a jittery cat,  
How was Rich supposed to make sense of that?  

He sighed and mumbled, “What’s Ian been drinking?”  
As he stared at the code with his brain slowly sinking.  
But with a grin, Rich clicked through with flair,  
After all, programmers know chaos is everywhere!
